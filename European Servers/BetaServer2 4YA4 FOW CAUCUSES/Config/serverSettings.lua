Welcome to 4YA Training Grounds mission, this mission is designed to help both new and experienced pilots refine \
their skills in their chosen airframe. The mission incorporates both fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft and the \
ability to train on both Air to Air/Air to Ground techniques, missile evasion, land-based circuit landings as \
well as carrier-based recovery operations. You may fly alone or with a wingman/squadron to develop skills essential in a coordinated attack.\

F10 MAP VIEW: Will only show allies. All airports that needs to be captured/defended have markers on the F10 map. If the airport has no friendly ground units visible on the F10 map, then it is hostile

EWRS notifications are available under "comms menu" & F10
Uses in-game radar information to detect targets so terrain masking, beaming, low altitude flying, etc is effective for avoiding detection.
Comms menu -> F10 (Others) -> EWRS -> Requst Bogey Dope

LABELS: Short range labels, will only show when you're within 2-3nm.

-THIS MISSION CAN BE PLAYED JUST LIKE OUR PVE MISSIONS IF THERE'S NOT ENOUGH PLAYERS. PLEASE STAY ON THE BLUE SIDE IN THAT CASE!

                           **HOW TO CAPTURE A BASE**

All enemies has to be eliminated on the airfield to be able to capture it. Once it's friendly you will be able to spawn at that location. You can use helicopters to transport vehicles and troops for extra support, drop them off close to a enemy airfield and they will guide themself to the nearest target. If you own combined arms you can command them yourself or even drive them. To pick up vehicles read the guide on how to use CTLD at the bottom of the briefing.

Server will restart when all required bases are captured.
If not completed within 11 hours the mission will fail.

If the red team manage to take back an airfield you need to re-capture it and place ground units on it again using helicopters.

Roadbases are available for Ajs37, F5e, F86F, Mig15, Mig19p and Mig21.  They are pre loaded with munition

Farps will become available as we capture airfields, CTLD is available and you will be able to pick up vehicles or troops straight from the farp. (Guide at the bottom of the briefing)

All planes have waypoints set to all airfields. "Open comms menu, (F10) to quick access waypoints list. 
People with Flaming Cliffs aircraft (FC3) can make use of this. (LCtrl + `) for next waypoint, and previous (LShift + `) 

You will find information like Waypoints and rules (F10) Comms menu.

                                   **GOOD TO KNOW**

1. When joining the server, instead of picking a plane right away, press "Briefing" in the bottom right corner and then open the F10 map to see where the best place to spawn would be.

2. It could be a bit confusing when there are multiple tankers, awacs and carriers. When trying to contact a tanker for example, the one that is on the top of the list on your "Comms menu" is the one that is closest to you. 

3. When using planes from Flaming cliffs 3, there can be a lot of chatter from the awacs. To turn this off (Recive mode) press (RShift + M) to cycle between the options.

4. On the top of the F10 map you have button called "show ruler". Click it and use right mouse button to get distance and bearing to your target.

5. Quick access to tacans, waypoints, jtac and side missions
are available on your "Comms menu" and (F10)

6. To remove the SRS box with frequencies from your screen 
press (LCtrl + LSift + ESC) to cycle between the different options.

7. Do not eject while you're on the ground. It will leave a wreck and damage taxiways, runways or damage nearby planes. Instead press ESC, select role and click "Back to spectator" to despawn your plane without leaving a mess.

8. Sometimes when trying to spawn on a carrier you will get the message "Your flight has been delayed, please wait". Try and select another slot on the same carrier. 

9. Labels are enabled on this server, meaning you will see 
red or blue dots. If you don't see lables you can turn them on by pressing (LShift + F11)

10. Built in FPS counter (LCtrl + Pause)

11. If you have any other questions join or discord, we have sections and guides for pretty much everything that revolves around DCS https://discord.gg/d5aTn6F

                              **CTLD INSTRUCTIONS**

1. PICKUP: While parked on the farp open up your comms menu and press F10, then CTLD. Here you can choose what you want to pick up. (troops or vehicles). You might have to move closer to the logistics center which is a structure placed close to the farp if it tells you that you're not close enough.

2. DROP CARGO: Once you found a spot where you want to place your vehicle/fob/troops open up comms menu, hit F10 and CTLD then CTLD Commands. 
Now you choose "drop cargo" 

3. UNPACK: Once you've dropped your cargo open comms menu, F10, CTLD and "CTLD commands" and choose unpack crates. Some vehciles requires multiple crates, will be shown by a number at the end, for example "sam avenger (2). 

4. TROOPS: Troops can be picked up at your farp or fob. When dropping them off they will start running towards the nearest target that is within 4000 meters. You can also give them orders if you own combined arms. Same works with all vehicles. 

5. FOB: Select "small FOB crate" in the CTLD menu, pick it up and drop it at a strategic location. You will need 3 of these crates. Once you have them all 3 close together then unpack. Will take 60 seconds for the FOB to be built. 
After that you will be able to pick up troops and vehicles when parked close to the FOB.

                                    **What is SRS?**

SRS is a free opensource VoIP program â€“ similar to TeamSpeak and Discord that allows you to easily communicate in the DCS MP environment using the inbuilt aircraft radios     http://dcssimpleradio.com/

On our discord under #srs-setup you will find a complete guide of how to install it and get it running.

Mk82 - 500lb dumb general purpose bomb
Mk83 - 1000lb dumb general purpose bomb
Mk84 - 2000lb dumb general purpose bomb

GPS guided weapons can only engage stationary targets as they are given a GPS position to hit
Laser guided weapons can engage moving targets as the weapon can follow the laser

Gbu12 - laser guided equivalent of mk82
Gbu16 - laser guided equivalent of mk82
Gbu10 - laser guided equivalent of mk84
Gbu38 - GPS guided equivalent of mk82

Cbu105 - GPS guided version of cbu97

                                  **ROCKETS/MISSILES**

US rockets come in several variants: 
HE - high explosive - light armored vehicles and infantry 
HEAT - high explosive anti tank - light/medium armored vehicles less splash than HE so less effective against infantry
WP - Willy Pete/white phosphorus - light skinned vehicles eg trucks and infantry also creates white smoke
Smoke/practise smoke - fires a smoke rocket that can help mark targets does no damage
Hydra rockets are the main rocket used by NATO they are 2.75in unguarded rockets that come in 7 and 19x launchers with or without areo cones.
Zuni rockets are 5in HE only rockets that come in launchers of 4, very effective against all vehicles but can have limited effectiveness against MBTs

Nato missiles come in 3 main mission types, SEAD, ANTI SHIP and Precision strike

Mavericks agm64x - mavericks can come in laser guided, tv guided or ir guided they differ in range and effect slightly but all are able to engage a single target at >=10nm
AGM-154x Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) The JSOW is a fire-and-forget weapon that use GPS/INS for navigation

AGM88 - HARM or ANTI RADIATION missile are used for shooting the radars of Sam stations and AAA.
At 30,000FT 350KTS it has a range of 70nm(ish)
AGM84 - Harpoon - anti ship missile - used to attack surface targets at ranges of 150nm+

                                         **GUNS**

Guns used by nato:
20mm vulcan - 20mm rotary cannon with very high fire rate but poor accuracy, probably the best AA gun in the world used on f18-16-15 can be used for light anti armor and infantry
25mm gau8 - 25mm rotary cannon with high fire rate with pinpoint accuracy up to 5nm+ effective against all vehicles, used only by av8b
30mm avenger - the great brrt, kills everything with 30mm depleted uranium hellfire, very high ROF and accuracy. Tank columns weep at the sound of the brrt.
30mm defa - revolver cannon - very effective against both air and ground med/high ROF and accuracy, more effective at killing ground targets than 20mm as the bigger round but harder to hit air targets as the round is quite slow
